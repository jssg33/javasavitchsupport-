   a) Ubuntu 24 with JDK and JRE loaded.
   b) Apache ANT installed (Equivalent to C/C++ Make).
   c) Command Line Only Needs.
   d) Bonuses-> Bluefish, Eclipse Java IDE.

This is a sample base for supporting CSC145 it is not anywhere near as complex as the Actual Homeworks and Exams which have elaborate compiler constructs.
However it is reference working code for the 1st 4 chapters sans graphics inputs in Phase I.
Phase II will include sample working code for the other items.
